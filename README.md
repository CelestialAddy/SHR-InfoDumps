# InfoDumps
The "InfoDumps" directory within this repository contains documentation on various random things in relation to the video game *The Simpsons: Hit & Run* that I feel comfortable writing about. 
The documentation is viewable on-site in the browser. 
This is supposed to be a sharable/copyable, imperfect, improved-when-possible resource that is helpful or at least interesting to some others.
Credit to [**Donut Team/community**](https://donutteam.com) for years of research and knowledge and tools that have helped me over time.
